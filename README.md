# PyCRM

## Intro
This repository is dedicated to solving various (complex) problems using software, primarily the Python programming language. More specifically  business solutions to Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Client and Data Management. Some problems can be solved or automated using simple code snippets, while more complex issues involve machine learning (A.I.) approaches.

Remember that well-organized businesses face less issues and have a higher productivity, especially when it comes to client, document and data management. It is essential to have structure and discipline within your organization, no matter your role in that company.

## Document Management
It's important to properly manage your digital documents such as scans, pictures, invoices, and on. Some businesses use CRM software for storing and labeling their client/project related files.

### OCR
It's not always easy to manage files, some businesses simply dump all files into a single folder but never clean it up. And when you have a high flux of files coming in on a daily basis you may feel overwhelmed. Or you may already find yourself in a big disorganized mess and feel discouraged. Fortunately technology can help us. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, it's a machine learning discipline focusing on extracting text from images/pictures. 

Regular text-based files can easily be read and parsed. But the OCR library allows us to easily and quickly parse text from image, pdf and docx files. The text/keywords obtained from these files can be used for labeling/processing files automatically.
